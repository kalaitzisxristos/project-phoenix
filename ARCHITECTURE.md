# Project Phoenix Architecture

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2023-10-27

This document outlines the architecture for Project Phoenix, a web application designed to serve as a high-level boilerplate for future projects. It details the core architectural principles, system components, technology stack, and key decisions made.

## 1. Core Architectural Principles

The architecture is designed with the following principles in mind:

-   **Scalability:** The system should be able to handle a growing number of users and data without a degradation in performance. Components are designed to be scaled horizontally.
-   **Maintainability:** The codebase should be easy to understand, modify, and extend. This is achieved through a modular design, clear separation of concerns, and comprehensive documentation.
-   **Resilience:** The system should be fault-tolerant. Failure in one component should not cascade and bring down the entire system.
-   **Security:** Security is a primary concern. We follow best practices for authentication, authorization, data encryption, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
-   **Observability:** The system must be easy to monitor and debug. Comprehensive logging, metrics, and tracing are integrated throughout the application.
-   **Cost-Effectiveness:** Technology choices and architecture patterns are made to be cost-effective, leveraging open-source solutions where possible.

## 2. System Architecture

The system follows a standard three-tier architecture, composed of a frontend client, a backend API, and a persistence layer. It is designed to be deployed using containers for consistency across environments.

### 2.1. Request Flow

1.  A user interacts with the **React** single-page application (SPA) in their browser.
2.  The frontend client makes API calls to the **Backend API (Node.js/Express)**.
3.  The Backend API processes the request, performs business logic, and interacts with the persistence layer.
4.  For data storage and retrieval, the API communicates with the **PostgreSQL** database.
5.  For faster access to frequently used data, the API interacts with the **Redis** cache.
6.  Asynchronous tasks and inter-service communication are handled via a **RabbitMQ** message broker.
7.  All services generate logs, which are shipped to **Loki** for aggregation and querying.
8.  Distributed tracing is handled by **Tempo** to monitor request flows across services.

### 2.2. Component Responsibilities

-   **Frontend (React):** Responsible for the user interface and user experience.
-   **Backend API (Node.js/Express):** Handles business logic, data processing, and authentication.
-   **Database (PostgreSQL):** Primary data store for the application.
-   **Cache (Redis):** Stores session data and caches frequently accessed database queries.
-   **Message Broker (RabbitMQ):** Manages asynchronous background jobs.

## 3. Technology Stack

The following table details the technology stack chosen for Project Phoenix.

| Component | Technology | Description | Rationale |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Frontend** | React | A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. | Rich ecosystem, component-based architecture, and strong community support. |
| **Backend API** | Node.js / Express | A JavaScript runtime and web framework. | Fast I/O, large package ecosystem (NPM), and allows for using a single language (JavaScript) across the stack. |
| **Database** | PostgreSQL | An open-source object-relational database. | Reliability, feature robustness, and strong support for complex queries and data types. |
| **Caching** | Redis | In-memory data structure store. | High performance for caching, session management, and real-time analytics. |
| **Message Broker** | RabbitMQ | A robust and mature message broker. | Supports multiple messaging protocols, provides reliable message delivery, and is ideal for decoupling services. |
| **Search** | Elasticsearch | A distributed, RESTful search and analytics engine. | Powerful full-text search capabilities, scalability, and real-time analytics. |
| **Observability (Logs)** | [Loki](https://grafana.com/oss/loki/) | A horizontally-scalable, highly-available, multi-tenant log aggregation system. | Cost-effective and easy to operate. Integrates well with Prometheus and Grafana. |
| **Observability (Traces)**| [Tempo](https://grafana.com/oss/tempo/) | An open source, easy-to-use and high-scale distributed tracing backend. | Requires only object storage to operate, making it cost-effective and easy to manage. |

## 4. Architectural Decisions

-   **Containerization (Docker):** All services will be containerized using Docker. This ensures consistency between development, staging, and production environments and simplifies deployment.
-   **Monorepo:** A monorepo will be used to manage the codebase for the frontend and backend. This simplifies dependency management and cross-service code sharing.
-   **API Design (RESTful):** The backend will expose a RESTful API. This is a well-understood, stateless, and scalable approach for building APIs.
